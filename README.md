A Library to revive depricated tags
Yeah, no idea what to put here, this project does *"work"*(feel free to submit a pull request and help with the project!(I'm a crap dev, **Help**)).

Sure well, here's the tags that are supported to date:
```<blink>```
```<center>```
```<font color="">```
```<font face="">```
```<acronym>```
```<big>```
```<small>```
```<tt>```
```<strike>/<s>/<del>```
```<u>```
```<abbr>```
```<dir>```
```<menu>```
```<body basefont-color="">```
```<body basefont-face="">```
```<plaintext>```
```<div align="">```
```<h1 align="">```
```<img align="">```
```<applet>```(Yes, full support - get you .class file ready)
```<nobr>```


Nonstandard tags just to screw with Whatwg:
`<tgu>`
`<tgu><sep></tgu>`
`<tgu><g></tgu>`
`<cf>`

That should be all the tags, hopefully I didn't forget any...
