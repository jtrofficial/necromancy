# necromancy
A Library to revive depricated tags
Yeah, no idea what to put here, this project does *"work"*(feel free to submit a pull request and help with the project!(I'm a crap dev, **Help**)).

Sure well, here's the tags that are supported to date:
```<blink>```
<center>
<font color="">
<font face="">
<font size="">
<acronym>
<big>
<small>
<tt>
<strike>/<s>/<del>
<u>
<abbr>




Nonstandard tags just to screw with Whatwg:
<tgu>
<tgu><sep></tgu>
<tgu><g></tgu>
<cf>


I coded yet never wants to work properly:
<nobr>
